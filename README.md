# My-Contact: Android Fundamentals

📱 A Practical Learning Project
A hands-on repository designed to demonstrate the core pillars of Android development. This project serves as a reference for implementing UI components, managing application flow, and handling user interaction.

🚀 Learning Objectives

Activities: Understanding the lifecycle and entry points.

Fragments: Creating modular, reusable UI components.

Layouts: Building responsive interfaces using ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout.

Listeners: Implementing OnClickListener and other event handlers for interactivity.

Intents: Navigating between screens and passing data via Bundles.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Java

Minimum SDK: API 21+

Design: Material Design Components

Build System: Gradle

✨ Features
Multi-Screen Navigation: Uses Intents to transition between a Login/Home activity and detail screens.

Dynamic UI: Uses Fragments to swap content within a single activity.

Data Passing: Demonstrates how to send strings or objects from one component to another.

Interactive Elements: Buttons, EditTexts, and Lists with custom Listeners.
